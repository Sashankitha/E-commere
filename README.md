  An e-commerce website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a seamless shopping experience. HTML creates the structure by displaying products, navigation menus, and forms for checkout. It uses elements like <div>, <img>, and <button> to organize content. CSS enhances the visual appearance, ensuring the site is responsive and user-friendly across devices. It defines layouts, colors, typography, and hover effects for buttons and images. JavaScript adds functionality, allowing dynamic interactions such as adding/removing items from the cart, calculating totals, and updating content without refreshing the page. JavaScript also handles form validation and AJAX requests for a smooth, interactive user experience. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create a visually appealing and functional e-commerce platform.
